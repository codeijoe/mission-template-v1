# Codeijoe™ Brand Identity & Guidelines

> **Tagline:** "Validate The Human, Audit The Machine."
> **Identity:** The Engineering Audit Authority.
> **Since:** November 5, 2024 (First Commercial Use).

## 1. The Core Narrative
Codeijoe exists to separate **Engineers** (who take liability) from **Prompters** (who generate code).
* **The Crisis:** "Vibe Coding" has flooded the industry with fragile, AI-generated software.
* **The Solution:** We provide "Brownfield Missions"—broken, legacy codebases that require Human Context to fix.

## 2. Terminology Enforcement (Strict)
To maintain the "High Stakes" environment, use these terms:

| BANNED TERM ❌ | REQUIRED TERM ✅ | CONTEXT |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coding Challenge** | **Audit Mission** | It's not a game; it's a forensic audit. |
| **Solution / Answer** | **Trade-off Analysis** | There is no single right answer, only choices. |
| **Student** | **Auditor / Challenger** | Active liability vs. Passive learning. |
| **Teacher** | **The System** | We verify; we don't teach. |

## 3. Visual & Voice
* **Tone:** Forensic, Industrial, "The Auditor".
* **Trademark:** The name "Codeijoe" must always carry the **™** symbol on its first mention in formal docs.
