# Codeijoe™ Professional Conduct Protocol

> **Status:** Active Enforcement
> **Applicability:** All Repositories, Pull Requests, and Issues.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
Codeijoe is not a social club; it is a **Professional Audit Simulation**.
We value **Integrity** over Comfort, and **Truth** over Politeness.

While we strictly enforce a harassment-free environment, we do not enforce "toxic positivity". Engineering reviews are critical, direct, and factual.

## 2. Standards of Conduct

### ✅ Required Behavior (The Professional)
* **Accountability:** Own your code. If you make a mistake, admit it and fix it.
* **Direct Communication:** Be concise. Don't fluff your sentences.
* **Reasoning:** Explain *why* you made a decision, not just *what* you did.
* **Respect for Time:** Read the documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) before asking questions.

### ❌ Prohibited Behavior (The Amateur)
* **AI Spamming:** Submitting unreviewed, auto-generated code just to "pass". This results in an immediate **Permanent Ban**.
* **Begging for Hints:** Opening Issues asking "How do I solve this?". This is an audit, not a tutorial.
* **Solution Leaking:** Posting full answers in public discussions. This ruins the proving ground for others.
* **Harassment:** Any form of sexism, racism, or personal attacks. We have zero tolerance for hate speech.

## 3. The "No Spoon-feeding" Clause
In the industry, your Senior Engineer is busy.
* **It is NOT a violation** of this Code of Conduct for a Maintainer to close your Issue with "Read the Manual" or "Debug it yourself."
* This is not hostility; this is the **Standard of Independence** we are testing for.

## 4. Enforcement Strategy

### The "One Strike" Policy for Integrity
* **Cheating / AI Spam / Tempering with Tests:** Immediate Ban. No appeal.

### The "Three Strike" Policy for Behavior
* **Unprofessional Conduct (Trolling/Spamming):**
    1.  **Warning:** Comment deleted & formal warning.
    2.  **Suspension:** 30-day block from the organization.
    3.  **Ban:** Permanent expulsion.

## 5. Reporting
If you witness genuine harassment or abuse (not just strict code review), report it directly to the Ops Commander at **iw@ijoe.eu.org**.
* *Note: Complaints about "The test is too hard" or " The bot is mean" will be ignored.*
