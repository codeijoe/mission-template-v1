# Codeijoe™ Governance & Intellectual Property Constitution

> **Version:** 3.0.0 (The Audit Authority)
> **Effective Date:** December 2025
> **Jurisdiction:** Global (via GitHub) & Republic of Indonesia (Legal Domicile)
> **Owner:** Indra Wahyudi (Common Law Trademark Holder)

## 1. PREAMBLE: THE AUDIT AUTHORITY
Codeijoe is not an open-source "community project" in the traditional sense. It is an **Engineering Audit Authority** operated under a **Benevolent Dictator For Life (BDFL)** model.

We provide a specialized service: **Validating Human Engineering Judgment in the Age of AI.**
To maintain the integrity of our "Audit Protocols" (The Traps), strict control over Intellectual Property (IP) and Brand usage is required.

## 2. THE POWER STRUCTURE

### 2.1 The Ops Commander (BDFL)
* **Authority:** **Indra Wahyudi**.
* **Powers:** Absolute veto on technical architecture, mission design, and licensing.
* **Succession:** Defined privately by the Owner.

### 2.2 The Maintainers (Senior Auditors)
* **Role:** Enforce the "Reasoning Check" on submissions.
* **Restriction:** Cannot modify the "Hidden Tests" or "Business Logic Traps" without BDFL approval.

### 2.3 The Auditors (Challengers)
* **Role:** Submit "Trade-off Analysis" and code fixes.
* **Rights:** Fork for personal "Proof of Work".
* **Prohibition:** Cannot redistribute Mission Solutions/Spoilers publicly.

## 3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & LICENSING (THE BUSINESS MODEL)

This is a **Hybrid Licensing Model** designed to protect the commercial value of Codeijoe while allowing personal use.

### 3.1 The Engine (Open Source)
* **Component:** The CI/CD Workflows (`.github/workflows`), Scripts (`gatekeeper.js`), and Runner Logic.
* **License:** **Apache License 2.0**.
* **Intent:** You may study how our automation works. You may contribute to the toolchain.

### 3.2 The Content & Traps (Proprietary / Restricted)
* **Component:** The specific **"Missions"**, **"Protocol Scenarios"**, **"Hidden Tests"**, **"Broken Code Patterns"**, and **"Documentation Logic"**.
* **License:** **CC BY-NC-ND 4.0** (Attribution - NonCommercial - NoDerivatives).
    * **❌ NO COMMERCIAL USE:** You CANNOT use Codeijoe Missions for paid bootcamps, corporate hiring tests, or employee training without a Commercial License from Indra Wahyudi.
    * **❌ NO DERIVATIVES:** You CANNOT fork a Mission, change the branding to "MyBootcamp", and release it.
* **Intent:** The value of Codeijoe lies in the *design of the trap*. This is our commercial asset.

### 3.3 User Submissions (The Inbound License)
By submitting a Pull Request (PR) to Codeijoe:
1.  You grant Codeijoe a **perpetual, royalty-free license** to use your code and reasoning for data analysis (e.g., "Hall of Fame" or "Red List" reports).
2.  You certify that the logic is **your own** (Human Reasoned) and accept the Liability Waiver.

## 4. BRAND PROTECTION & TRADEMARK

### 4.1 The "Codeijoe" Mark
"Codeijoe" and "The Engineering Audit Authority" are trademarks of Indra Wahyudi.
* **Authorized Use:** You may use the Codeijoe badge on your LinkedIn/Resume as "Verified Auditor".
* **Unauthorized Use:** You may NOT use "Codeijoe" to imply partnership or endorsement for your own course/product.

### 4.2 Platform Integrity
* **Anti-Cloning:** Replicating the Codeijoe "Audit Workflow" (Bot + Content) within GitHub under a confusingly similar name is a violation of our IP rights and will be reported to GitHub Trust & Safety (DMCA).

## 5. COMMERCIAL USE & HIRING
**Attention Companies & Recruiters:**

Using Codeijoe Public Repositories to screen candidates for your company is **Prohibited** under the Non-Commercial license, UNLESS:
1.  You have a written agreement/license from Codeijoe.
2.  OR you are engaging Indra Wahyudi as a consultant for the hiring process.

*To obtain a Commercial License for internal team assessment, contact the Owner.*

## 6. LIABILITY WAIVER (THE "AS-IS" CLAUSE)
**The "Audit" provided by Codeijoe is a simulation.**
* Codeijoe certifies that a user has passed our specific traps. We DO NOT guarantee their future performance in your company.
* The platform is provided "AS IS". We are not liable for career decisions, lost data, or ego damage resulting from failed audits.

---
*Failure to comply with this Constitution will result in a permanent ban from the Codeijoe Ecosystem and potential legal action for IP infringement.*
